        "query": "3x3",
        "response": "The result of multiplying a 3x3 matrix by another 3x3 matrix is a new 3x3 matrix. This can be done by multiplying each element in the first matrix by its corresponding element in the second matrix, and then summing the products for each element in the resulting matrix.\n\nFor example, let's say we have two 3x3 matrices:\n\nMatrix A:  \n1 2 3  \n4 5 6  \n7 8 9  \n\nMatrix B:  \n9 8 7  \n6 5 4  \n3 2 1  \n\nTo multiply these two matrices, we perform the following calculations:\n\n1*9 + 2*6 + 3*3 = 9 + 12 + 9 = 30  \n1*8 + 2*5 + 3*2 = 8 + 10 + 6 = 24  \n1*7 + 2*4 + 3*1 = 7 + 8 + 3 = 18  \n\n4*9 + 5*6 + 6*3 = 36 + 30 + 18 = 84  \n4*8 + 5*5 + 6*2 = 32 + 25 + 12 = 69  \n4*7 + 5*4 + 6*1 = 28 + 20 + 6 = 54  \n\n7*9 + 8*6 + 9*3 = 63 + 48 + 27 = 138  \n7*8 + 8*5 + 9*2 = 56 + 40 + 18 = 114  \n7*7 + 8*4 + 9*1 = 49 + 32 + 9 = 90  \n\nTherefore, the resulting 3x3 matrix from the multiplication of Matrix A and Matrix B is:\n\n30 24 18  \n84 69 54  \n138 114 90"
